# Ri1W-2019
RoboJackets does Robot in 1 weekend

This year we prototyped two systems for moving the blocks- one using a wheeled intake and a seperate gripper end effector, and the other using a top-down wheeled gripper, which does not need a seperate intake system. As these have different electrical and software needs, there are seperate methods and instantiations, which need to be commented or uncommented to switch between the two.

For the autoop, vuphoria is dependent on an xml file for the markers used for that years field. With this being unavailable at the time of building and the time constraints with Ri1W, we decided to pre program set movements opposed to a reactive system with vision.
